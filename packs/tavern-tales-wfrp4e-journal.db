This adventure takes place in a dark gothic town, but can easily be placed in any setting or city that might have an abandoned warehouse above an old, underground hideout. This adventure can be played as a one-shot adventure or placed into a longer-running campaign.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Fifty years ago, a faction of witch hunters in the town hoped to build an underground safehouse from which they could organize their operations on the surface. Construction initially proceeded quickly, but was soon halted by the strange discovery of underground pools of thick, red viscous liquid thought to be blood. Fearing demonic influence, the witch hunters organized a ritualistic cleansing and exorcism of the site. Their fears were correct, and the ritual went horribly wrong &mdash; demons bubbled up from the blood pools and attacked the witch hunters, eviscerating their number and forcing the few who remained to flee, leaving the unfinished safehouse abandoned beneath the streets of the city.</p>\n<p>Recently, the priest Vekhar has heard the whispering of the ruinous powers in his ear. They have told him that the blood pools below the city have begun to stir once more, and that the time is right to baptize the worthy in their depths. Having gathered a cult following known as the Bloody Hand, Vekhar has established himself at the pools and has begun to baptize cultists and kidnapping victims alike in the blood, turning them into @Actor[Dretch]. At the command of his masters, Vekhar keeps the dretchs contained in the underground lair, in wait for the perfect moment to unleash them onto the unsuspecting citizens of the town.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<p>There are many reasons the characters may be interested in thwarting the activities of a demonic cult. A few of these are outlined below:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">A daughter abducted. </span>Mary Willstead's daughter was abducted from the streets last night by a group of men in red robes, assumed to be members of the Bloody Hand. Panicked and horrified, she requests the adventurers infiltrate their hideout and rescue her daughter, if it is not already too late.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Bitter rivals. </span>The Scarlet Guerilla Band, a local town gang of drunken workmen, is wary of the rise of a cult that infringes on their turf and would like to see them exterminated. Unfamiliar with the Hand's resources and eager to contract out some potentially dangerous work, they hire the adventurers to kill as many members of the Bloody Hand as they can, offering 5 ss for each dead member and an additional 1 gc if their leader, Vekhar, is slain.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Concerned cleric</span>. A local cleric familiar with the town's historical records knows of the blood pools underneath the streets of the town. Having heard that the Bloody Hand occupies the area in which they are suspected to be located, he fears their use for nefarious ends. He offers to pay the characters 2 gc to investigate the Bloody Hand hideout and determine its relation to the blood pools, and eliminate the cult entirely if possible.</p>\n<h2>Finding the Hideout</h2>\n<p>The Bloody Hand have not made much effort to conceal their presence. Though the exact location of their hideout is not well-known by common folk, many know that the cult's members can be easily found in Eisenkreis, the smithing and warehouse district. No matter the hook used to entice the characters to adventure, they will have been told to find the warehouse marked with a bloody handprint on its door; the all-but-confirmed hideout of the cult.</p>\n<p>The exact location of the hideout can be determined in a number of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A successful average @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.d3VZwO4Y5JH5DXdT]{Bribery} test (against an unwittingly drunken man) of the Eisenkreis neighborhood to locate the warehouse that bears the cult's mark;</li>\n<li>A successful difficult @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership} test to find and convince a local to share what they know of the cult's location, despite their fears of retaliation;</li>\n<li>A successful challenging @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception} test to spot the red-robed cultists during an overnight stakeout of the neighborhood, and a subsequently successful average @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.McTtmZu3Ac8Lh48W]{Stealth (Any)} test to follow them back to the hideout.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Infiltrating the Warehouse</h2>\n<p>One way or another, the adventurers will eventually locate the hideout of the Bloody Hand: an abandoned warehouse in the Eisenkreis neighborhood. The two-story warehouse fronts onto the cobbled main street of the district, and is flanked by two narrow dirt alleys on its east and west sides. Its windows are boarded up, and a heavy padlock hangs from thick chains that keep the front doors closed. The warehouse can be entered three different ways:</p>\n<p>The padlock on the front door can be picked with a successful challenging @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.AkjRsazdAppqveZu]{Pick Lock} test.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A successful challenging @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception} test reveals that the warehouse wall along the east alley reveals a secret door built into the wood. This door is unlocked, and acts as the primary entrance for cult members.</li>\n<li>A successful difficult @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.bSWoV1IiS5qWNw39]{Evaluate} or average @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.osMw1Be6YgRBolTm]{Lore (Engineering)} test reveals that the warehouse wall along the west alley reveals some loose panels in the fa&ccedil;ade some 12 feet above ground level. By stacking some nearby crates, climbing to the panels, and successfully prying them free with a challenging @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.sRuMlaPU5xdIrwhd]{Climb} or difficult @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics} test, a hole can be created large enough for Medium or smaller creatures to climb up and through into the warehouse's second-story loft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The warehouse itself has not been in formal use for years, and is empty of any Bloody Hand members. Its interior is 60-foot-by-60-foot, consisting of a single-room first floor and a second-story loft accessible via ladders near the west wall of the room. It is mostly empty, and is filled with only a dozen crates or so, each filled with rotting lumber. A 7-foot-by-7 foot trapdoor in the floor near the south wall leads to the underground hideout of the Bloody Hand.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Cellar Door. </span>A staircase of rotting wood leads downwards from the trapdoor into the expansive, mostly empty cellar of the warehouse. At the cellar's east end, the wooden foundation of the walls gives away to an expanded cavern in the rock.</p>\n<h2>Bloody Hand Hideout</h2>\n<p>The Bloody Hand have made their hideout in the abandoned construction of a former witch hunter safehouse, where natural caverns underneath the warehouse connect to an unfinished stone complex consisting of a few rooms and hallways adjacent to the blood pools. Unless otherwise stated, the hideout's features are described as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ceilings. </span>Ceilings in the hideout's rooms and hallways built from grey limestone and are 3 yards high.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Floors and Walls. </span>Like the ceilings, floors and walls are built from the same grey limestone. Walls are 1 yard thick.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Doors. </span>Doors are made of oak, with a double layer of timber forming outer and inner boards.&nbsp; They are unlocked.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Light. </span>The hideout is well-lit by torches mounted in sconces on the walls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Sticky's Den</span></h3>\n<p>A character approaching this cavern who succeeds on a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception} test can hear a deep voice appearing to have a conversation with itself.</p>\n<p>When a creature enters the room for the first time, read the following:</p>\n<p>The rocky opening in the west end of the warehouse cellar continues into a spacious cavern of rock that branches to the north, east, and south. In the middle of the cavern, the rock floor dips a few feet in elevation to create a ledge of rock running north-south.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Encounter: Sticky the Ogre</span>. Unless he has been alerted to disturbance elsewhere in the hideout, Sticky the Ogre is here. The voice heard is Sticky's, as he sits against the rock ledge in this cavern playing \"dolls\" with skeletal remains discovered in the hideout by the Bloody Hand.</p>\n<p>Sticky is a domesticated ogre who originally was used to haul cargo in the city of Blutstrom. After being \"adopted\" by the Bloody Hand, Vekhar attempted to baptize Sticky in the blood of the blood pools. The baptism had unforeseen effects, and Sticky was infused with demonic energy and hideously deformed by the pools. The left side of his face looks to have melted into this shoulder, and the flesh of his left arm is shrivelled and blackened. Characters can sneak past him with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check due to his distraction, otherwise, Sticky has been instructed to immediately attack any intruders (those not wearing the robes of the Bloody Hand). He fights until he has half of his hit points or fewer, at which point he attempts to flee back up through the warehouse and into the streets above.</p>\n<p>Sticky is an <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ogre: </span>@Actor[Sticky The Ogre]</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Meeting Room </span></h3>\n<p>A rectangular wooden meeting table is surrounded by six stools in the middle of this chamber. Atop the table, a dagger has been thrust into the wood through a scrap of parchment. To the south, the room expands slightly into an unfinished alcove in the rock, where old digging tools have been left on the ground. Double doors exit to the north and east.</p>\n<p>The dagger is functional and well-crafted, but of little other value. The parchment bears a list of names &mdash; potential kidnapping and murder targets for the Bloody Hand.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Prayer Alcove</span></h3>\n<p>A 4-foot-tall stone obelisk stands in the center of this alcove, its surface carved with runes and foul scripts that burn the eyes to look upon. A hallway exits to the west, and a doorway exits to the north.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Encounter: Cultists</span>. Unless alerted to disturbance elsewhere in the hideout, four @Actor[Cultist] are here, surrounding the obelisk in silent prayer. They fight until three of their number are slain, at which point the remaining cultist attempts to flee and warn Vekhar in area L7 of the intrusion.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Hazard: Demonic Obelisk. </span>This obelisk was built by the Bloody Hand has been blessed by the ruinous powers. Any creature who moves within 4 yards of the obelisk is exposed to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.xsGbDFqK2qh7lsIj]{Corruption} (Minor). Touching the obelisk is a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.xsGbDFqK2qh7lsIj]{Corruption} (Moderate).</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Storage</span></h3>\n<p>This small chamber holds a half-dozen crates and a few barrels. The containers hold dry foodstuffs, spare robes, rope, and small amounts of excess weaponry.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Cultist's Quarters</span></h3>\n<p>Three bunk beds are pushed up against the walls of this room. At the foot of each bunk is an iron strongbox. A wooden rack holds clothing and Bloody Hand robes along the west wall. Doors exit to the north and south.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Treasure: Strongboxes. </span>The strongboxes are unlocked. They hold a cumulative value of 1gc and 6ss and two<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> </span>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.gxdjLQoQUTYgD6fm]{Healing Draught}. Inside one of the strongboxes, folded within an old shirt, is a @Item[Beautiful Ring].</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. Witch Hunter Statue</span></h3>\n<p>This room is lined with six narrow pillars that support the ceiling. A 10-foot-tall statue of a bearded man wielding two swords and wearing a wide-brimmed hat stands in front of the north wall. The statue has been defaced; it is covered in graffiti and the nose on its face has been broken off. At its base, a plaque reads: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"</span>Callum M. Mocklins - Founder of the local witch hunters\".</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. Vekhar's Quarters</span></h3>\n<p>A bed, wardrobe, and small, blood-stained stone altar fill most of this room. Two torn-up rabbit carcasses lie on the floor near the north wall. A chest sits at the foot of the bed. Atop the altar, a scroll of parchment bears Abyssal script.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Treasure: Chest.</span> The chest at the foot of the bed is locked, requiring a successful challenging @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.AkjRsazdAppqveZu]{Pick Lock} test, a successful difficult @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics} test, or the key found on Vekhar's person to open. Inside the chest is a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><strong>book of Lore (Life) magic</strong> </span>and a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.gxdjLQoQUTYgD6fm]{Healing Draught}.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Encounter: Vekhar. </span>Unless they have been alerted to disturbance elsewhere, @Actor[Vekhar] is here scribing an Corrupting scroll atop the altar while his two pet @Actor[Blood Mastiff] feast upon the rabbit carcasses. Vekhar's forearms drip with his own blood, which he has been using to scribe. Vekhar and his dogs fight to the death.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">8. Cells</span></h3>\n<p>These 10-by-10 dark, damp and bare cells are fitted with iron bar doors. Two cultist enforcers (@Compendium[world.tavern-tales-wfrp4e-actors.SogF7iwnM6V2VS8X]{Cultist Thug}) stand guard in the hallway outside the cells. The doors are locked, requiring a successful challenging @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.AkjRsazdAppqveZu]{Pick Lock} test to open or the key held by one of the enforcers.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Encounter: A daughter abducted. </span>The south cell is empty, but locked in the north cell is @Actor[Anna Willstead], daughter of Mary Willstead. She was abducted by the Bloody Hand while walking home from the tavern a few nights ago. Though tired and weak, Anna is eager in wanting to help the adventurers deal with the cult, and asks if she may be given a weapon to help fight if necessary. An average @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership} test is required to convince her that it may be best for her own safety to keep away from combat; she is otherwise pestering in her enthusiasm.</p>\n<h3><strong>9. Blood Pools</strong></h3>\n<p>Much of this spacious cavern is filled with two pools of softly bubbling, thick red liquid; one in the cavern's center and one at its east end. A pulley system connected to an iron lever built into the southeast wall holds an iron cage aloft above the center pool. Near the cavern's north wall, a larger 10-foot-by-10-foot iron cage is packed densely with ten <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">dretchs</span>, who gnash fruitlessly at the bars.</p>\n<p>The suspended iron cage is what the Bloody Hand uses to baptize people in the blood pools. When their baptism is complete, the new <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">dretch</span> is herded into the larger iron cage for storage, the key to which hangs on a loop in the wall nearby.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Hazard: Blood pools. </span>A creature who touches the blood pools immediately takes 1 wound and suffers an immediate @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.xsGbDFqK2qh7lsIj]{Corruption} (Moderate) exposure. This is repeated for constant exposure to the blood.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>A character submerged in the blood pools for 3 rounds or longer has a 50% chance of becoming a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">dretch</span>. A character who makes a successful average @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.ZQzRZkB9JK1CveMW]{Lore (Magick)} can determine that to eliminate the Corrupting influence from the pools, a significant amount of Lore (Life) magic must be channeled into the pools within a short space of time - only Life can purge the foulness within.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Encounter: Dretchs. </span>If the dretchs remain in the cage, they pose little threat to adventurers attempting to slay them. Any character thrusting a sword or similar weapon through the bars of the cage can systematically kill all of the dretchs within a matter of minutes, without requiring an initiative roll. If the dretchs are released from the cage, they immediately attack the nearest creatures in the area.</p>\n<h2>Aftermath</h2>\n<p>Assuming the characters successfully eliminate the Bloody Hand, a few loose ends still remain. If they rescued Anna Willstead, she insists that she can return to her mother safely on her own, though does not protest if they wish to accompany her. The characters may or may not decide to slay all the dretchs in the hideout. If the dretchs are left unsupervised and not dealt with, they manage to chew through the iron bars and escape after 1d8 weeks. If the characters do not have access to the spells required to cleanse the pools and wish to rid them of Corrupting influence, they may consult a Life wizard at the Altdorf college, who would likely be interested in ridding the evil presence for bragging rights.</p>","img":"modules/tavern-tales-adventures/artwork/bloodyhand_hideout_labels.webp","_id":"NOqxMiDSN62ifsNE"}
