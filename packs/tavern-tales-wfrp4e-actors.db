Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

While most often associated with martial situations, a resolute leader can quickly direct a fast response to a fire or other such calamity, and nobles use the Skill frequently to command their lessers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A successful Leadership Test allows you to issue orders to a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus + SL. If the targets are your natural subordinates — a noble commanding serfs, or a sergeant commanding his troops — commands are usually unopposed. If there is no natural hierarchy in place, or the order is particularly challenging — such as ordering your soldiers to charge a Hydra head on — the Test is Opposed by your targets’ Cool.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Leadership to encourage your subordinates. A successful Leadership Test confers a bonus of +10 to all Psychology Tests until the end of the next round (see page 190).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further, Leadership can be used to transfer Advantage to allies able to hear you; following a successful Leadership Test, you may transfer an Advantage to one ally of your choice, plus a further +1 Advantage per SL scored, which can again go to any allies of your choice within earshot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lord Ludwig von Schemp has been watching his two bodyguards discourse with some ruffians for three Rounds, using his Intuition Skill to build up 3 Advantage.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Stealth is generally Opposed by an opponent’s Perception Skill, and Tests will be modifed by how dark or well concealed your route is, as well as how circumspectly you are dressed. An Impressive or Astounding Failure on a Stealth Test will likely draw the immediate attention of the enemies you were trying to avoid in the first place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stealth has many potential applications in combat, most usefully to hide oneself in preparation for an Ambush, or to creep around an opponent in order to attack from behind. Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conﬂict unseen…</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Rural, Underground, Urban&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Options: Shadowing</h3>\n<p>Shadowing is following someone secretly. To do this requires a Combined Perception and Stealth Test. If the target is actively trying to lose a tail, it is Opposed with the target’s Stealth Skill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you pass the Perception Test, and fail the Stealth Test you follow your target, but are spotted. If you fail the perception Test, yet pass the Stealth Test, you lose your target, but go unnoticed</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"isSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"ag"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-ag.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Ggx0bRaCuq8MbF0g","name":"Gold Crown","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":240},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/goldcrown.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"KB8HgDz56dh2w7w1","name":"Silver Shilling","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":12},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/silvershilling.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"0MYOJFx3vkYA95B4","name":"Brass Penny","type":"money","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"quantity":{"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","value":0},"encumbrance":{"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","value":0.005},"location":{"type":"Number","label":"Location","value":0},"coinValue":{"label":"Value (in d)","type":"Number","value":1},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/currency/brasspenny.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"YDxRmbpsqpB1Y5hA","name":"Priest","type":"career","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.GNwQFkVKUs0JM6U5]{Priest}</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"careergroup":{"type":"String","label":"Career Group","value":"Priest"},"class":{"type":"String","label":"Class","value":"Academics"},"current":{"type":"Boolean","value":false},"complete":{"type":"Boolean","value":false},"level":{"type":"String","label":"Career Level","value":"2"},"status":{"tier":"s","standing":1},"characteristics":["t","ag","wp","fel"],"skills":["Athletics","Cool","Endurance","Intuition","Lore (Theology)","Perception","Pray","Research","Charm","Entertain (Storytelling)","Gossip","Heal","Intimidate","Melee (Basic)"],"talents":["Blather","Bookish","Etiquette (Cultists)","Invoke (Any)"],"trappings":["Book (Religion)","Ceremonial Robes"],"incomeSkill":[6],"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details","core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.wfrp4e-core.careers.AtWEBwIobFnhbQy7"}},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/careers/priest-02.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"hcTUP2X2uCmCkOO2","name":"Etiquette","type":"talent","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>You can blend in socially with the chosen group so long as you are dressed and acting appropriately.

You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.

The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.
